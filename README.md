# crypto-icons

This began as a fork of https://github.com/spothq/cryptocurrency-icons, and many of the icons in this repo are from there.

I made this fork so that I could add many, many more icons (almost 900 now, including the originals from SpotHQ) without pestering the Spot team. I then realised that the repo was very ambitious with a lot of variants for each icon. Great in theory. Hard to maintain in practice, given the proliferation of crypto assets.

So I have stripped out all but the colour 128 PNG versions, leaving the originals in a public Figma file which I will add to the README shortly. I hope this will enable me to keep this repo lean and well-maintained.

Anyone who wants another format or larger PNG can export SVG, PDF or any size PNG they want from the Figma file.

Thank you to SpotHQ and all the spot contributors.
